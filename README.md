# PersonalPortfolio

This portfolio website is my single point of contact to display my AWS and software development skills. I am always adding new functionality, and this website contains multiple microservices which utilize many AWS services. Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:lavellej286@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans) with any questions on the code base - or feel free to also contact me via the contact form on the website itself!
